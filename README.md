# Conceptual formulation

The first exercise in the course **"Eingabe-Ausgabe"** was to device an analgogue algorithm.
It need to be precise and clear for the people who put it into execution.
After a couple of tries and improvements i came to following result:

###Instructions###

**Materials: 3 different water-color mix, pen, Setsquare, black felt pen, injection**

0. Write any number on the back of your paper

1. Take the injection and spread the color with eyes closed drop per drop over the frontside of the paper.
 (Min. 10 drops)

2. Let the dabs getting dry

3. Draw an ellipse arround every dab whose range isn`t bigger the the range of the pen  Smaller dabs can be inside of an ellipse as well.Every ellipse need to carve minimum one other ellipse. Ellipses can get over the end of the paper.

4. Mark every point of intersection with the black felt pen 

5. If you had written an even number on the back of your paper follow step **6a**
  Otherwise follow step **6b**

  6a Link all marked points of intersection with the black felt pen 

  6b Retrace every line which you have made befor with your pen with the black felt pen.

# Evaluation

I was realy satisfied with the results i receved. The algorithm was explicated mostly right and looked like the images i had in mind.
I could manage that the images do not all look the same but it is still clear that all the people who put the alorithm into execution had the same task.


# Resume

I think it was a very good exercise to practise express myself.
It was neccesary to think about every single word. *Is this information realy needed or can i remove this?
Can this sentence be more short and precise? Would i undestand this if i would read the instruction the first time?*
Keep things simple but not boring is one sentence wich describes this exercise the best in my eyes.
