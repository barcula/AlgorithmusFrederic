# Conceptual formulation

The first exercise in the course **"Eingabe-Ausgabe"** was to device an analgogue algorithm.
It need to be as precise and clear as possible for the people who put it into execution.

### Instructions of first version
( 5 minutes speed exercise)

+ Draw 10 or more circles on a squarish drawing surface
+ A circle have to touch or carve minimum one other circle
+ If there are generated more then 5 intersections hatch them blue
+ If there are generated less then 5 intersections hatch them red

Theese are the results of the very beginning:

  These thing weren`t clear enough and could be understould in different ways:
  
  + Draw 10 or more circles on a squarish drawing surface
  + A => **Every circle** have to touch or carve minimum one other circle
  + If there are generated **overall** more then 5 intersections hatch them => **the intersections** blue
  + If there are generated **overall** less then 5 intersections hatch them => **the intersections** red
  
After the course discused the results of erveryone our task was to improve the algorithm and give it to 10 persons to put it into execution
  
### Instructions of the second version

Materials: white paper, green red and blue colored felt pen, mix of differnt pens, ball pens and so on

+ Draw minimum 20 circles in different sizes on the sheet
+ Every circle have to touch or carve minimum one other circle
+ If there are generated more then 10 intersections hatch the intesections blue
+ If there are generated less then 10 intersections hatch the intesections red
+ Mark every point of intersection and osculation point with the green marker
+ Connect every green point with each other.

These are the results of the second version executed by ten differnt people:

### Instructions of the final version


**Materials: 3 different water-color mix, pen, Setsquare, black felt pen, injection**

0. Write any number on the back of your paper

1. Take the injection and spread the color with eyes closed drop per drop over the frontside of the paper.
 (Min. 10 drops)

2. Let the dabs getting dry

3. Draw an ellipse arround every dab whose range isn`t bigger the the range of the pen  Smaller dabs can be inside of an ellipse as well.Every ellipse need to carve minimum one other ellipse. Ellipses can get over the end of the paper.

4. Mark every point of intersection with the black felt pen 

5. If you had written an even number on the back of your paper follow step **6a**
  Otherwise follow step **6b**

  6a Link all marked points of intersection with the black felt pen 

  6b Retrace every line which you have made befor with your pen with the black felt pen.

# Evaluation

I was realy satisfied with the results i receved. The algorithm was explicated mostly right and looked like the images i had in mind.
I could manage that the images do not all look the same but it is still clear that all the people who put the alorithm into execution had the same task.

# Resume

I think it was a very good exercise to practise express myself.
It was neccesary to think about every single word. *Is this information realy needed or can i remove this?
Can this sentence be more short and precise? Would i undestand this if i would read the instruction the first time?*
Keep things simple but not boring is one sentence wich describes this exercise the best in my eyes.
