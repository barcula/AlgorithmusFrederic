# Conceptual formulation

The first exercise in the course "Eingabe-Ausgabe" was to device an analgogue algorithm.
It need to be precise and clear for the people who put it into execution.
After a couple of tries and improvements i came to following result:
You can read the instructions here.

# Evaluation

I was realy satisfied with the results i receved. The algorithm was explicated mostly right and looked like the images i had in mind.
I could manage that the images do not all look the same but it is still clear that all the people who put the alorithm into execution had the same task.


# Resume

I think it was a very good exercise to practise express myself.
It was neccesary to think about every single word. Is this information realy needed or can i remove this?
Can this sentence be more short and precise? Would i undestand this if i would read the instruction the first time?
Keep things simple but not boring is one sentence wich describes this exercise the best in my eyes.
